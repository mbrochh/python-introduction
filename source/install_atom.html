      ## What is this flake8 and linter thing?

      * A **linter** is a program that checks if<br />
        the code of another program looks pretty
      * **flake8** is a Python program that is able to <br />
        *lint* your Python code for you.
      * There are many more linters, basically every<br />
        programming language has it's own.
      * If you want to learn how Python code should be written<br />
        grab some popcorn and read the famous [PEP008](https://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0008/)<br />
        Not now! It's a long read ;)
