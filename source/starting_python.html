      ## Important Hint

      1. You are in the Python interpreter when you see<br />
         **>>>** at the beginning of the line
      1. This means you are *no longer in the normal terminal*
      1. Terminal commands like **ls** and **cd** will not work here
      1. Only commands of the Python programming language<br /> will work here
      1. You will almost never need to start the Python interpreter
      1. You only start it if you want to test some Python commands
