      ##Introduction

      * No one can learn programming in a day
        * or in a week
        * or in a month
        * or in a year
      * If you want to become really good
        * you have to try things yourself
        * you should find a mentor or a user group to guide you
      * This tutorial is just a tiny step into the right direction
      * I hope that
        * it empowers you to take more steps on your own
        * you will come back for more :)
