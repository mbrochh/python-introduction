      ##Debugging your program

      * This is an advanced topic
      * We will not have enough time to train this<br />
        during the workshop
      * I'm putting this into the slides because it is<br />
        the last crucial tool that you need for real<br />
        software development
      * Instal ipdb
        ```bash
        # On OSX/Ubuntu:
        sudo pip install ipdb

        # On Windows:
        pip install ipdb
        ```
    </script>

      ##Place a breakpoint into your code

      * When debugging programs, you place so called **breakpoints**
      * For Python, you need to paste this into your code:
        ```python
        import ipdb; ipdb.set_trace()
        ```
      * Luckily, Atom has a plugin for this, so you can<br />
        just press **F7** at the position where you want the<br />
        breakpoint.

      ##Now run your program

      * After placing the breakpoint, run your program as usual
        ```bash
        python your_filename.py
        ```
      * Instead of executing normally, the program will<br />
        stop at your breakpoint
      * Now you have all the time in the world to inspect<br />
        your variables
      * You can also move to the next line in the program<br />
        one step at a time

      ##How to use ipdb

      * When you are inside of the ipdb debugger:
      * Press **?** to get all possible commands
      * Press **? bt** to get help for the **bt** command
      * **l**: Shows the current line
      * **bt**: Shows the full stack trace
      * **n**: Jumps to the next line
      * **a**: Shows all arguments of the current function
      * **c**: Continue execution until the program ends
      * Type in a variable name to see it's value
      * You can even change variables and continue the program
