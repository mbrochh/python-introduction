      ##A Command-Line Crash Crouse

      * The command line is a window where you can execute text-commands
      * On Windows it is called "PowerShell"
      * On OSX and Ubuntu it is called the "Terminal"
      * For simplicity, we will always call it the "Terminal"
    </script>

      ##Windows: The PowerShell

      ##Your Home Folder

      * Type **pwd** into the terminal:
        ```bash
        pwd
        ```
      * It will show which folder you are currently in
      * For a newly opened terminal, that is your home folder
      * Your home folder is also called "**~**" (tilde)
      * No matter where you are, you can type **cd ~**<br />
        to get into your home folder
        ```bash
        cd ~
        ```
      * By the way: **pwd** stands for **print working directory**

      ##List The Current Folder

      * Hint: "folder" and "directory" is the same
      * I say folder, because it's shorter to write :)
      * Type **ls** to list the content of the current folder
        ```bash
        ls
        ```
      * By the way: **ls** stands for **list**

        called "Projects"
        ```bash
        mkdir Projects
        ```
      * How about creating a folder for our first project as well?
      * Type **cd ~/Projects** and then **mkdir test**
        ```bash
        cd ~/Projects
        mkdir test
        ```

      * Type **cd ~/Projects/test** to move into your test project folder
        ```bash

      * On OSX/Ubuntu, type **touch test.py** to create a new file called "test.py"
        ```bash
        touch test.py
        ```
      * On Windows, type **echo $null >> test.py**
        ```bash
        echo $null >> test.py
        ```
      * So sorry, Windows doesn't have a nicer command for creating files :(
      * Type **ls** to see if your new file is there
        ```bash
        ls
        ```
